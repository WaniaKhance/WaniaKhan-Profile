excerpt: 'The proliferating energy data generation poses significant challenges across various energy applications. This study focuses on one such energy application: cost-optimization of single households. Households with limited computing capacity need an online decision-making process to efficiently utilize their renewable resources and effectively manage their energy data. This paper presents OPTAAS (Optimization as a Service), a framework designed to implement online decision-making for households to resolve optimization problems efficiently and in a timely manner.'
