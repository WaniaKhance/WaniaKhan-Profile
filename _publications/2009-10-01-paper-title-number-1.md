excerpt: 'This paper presents AI based modeling strategies for effective energy management with a particular emphasis on DC’s two most energy intensive systems (i.e., cooling and IT systems). This study addresses the issues of IT equipment performance degradation, inappropriate IT room thermal conditions, inefficient workload placement, and excessive energy waste. This research entails the application of machine learning for DC thermal classification, and deployment of deep learning models to predict resource utilization and energy consumption in DC.'
