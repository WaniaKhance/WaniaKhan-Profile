excerpt: ' Generated heat in the data center is categorized into different granularity levels namely: server level, rack level, room level, and data center level. Several datasets are collected at ENEA Portici Data Center from CRESCO 6 cluster - a High-Performance Computing Cluster. This research aims to conduct a rigorous exploratory data analysis on each dataset separately and collectively followed in various stages. This work presents descriptive and inferential analyses for feature selection and extraction process. Furthermore, a supervised Machine learning modelling and correlation estimation is performed on all the datasets to abstract relevant features, that would have an impact on energy efficiency in data centers.'

Generated heat in the data center is categorized into different granularity levels namely: server level, rack level, room level, and data center level. Several datasets are collected at ENEA Portici Data Center from CRESCO 6 cluster - a High-Performance Computing Cluster. This research aims to conduct a rigorous exploratory data analysis on each dataset separately and collectively followed in various stages. This work presents descriptive and inferential analyses for feature selection and extraction process. Furthermore, a supervised Machine learning modelling and correlation estimation is performed on all the datasets to abstract relevant features, that would have an impact on energy efficiency in data centers.
